&lt;p>It was dark out. The time was such that most people had already left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sitting by himself on a dim-lit corner of the room, the strange man worked away. His weapon of choice? An old ThinkPad. His focus was so diligent one could mistake it for some sort of trance. As it often does, it intrigued me, so I approached.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Hey, what are you doing here so late?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Error Propagation Calculator</title><link>https://joselopes.dev/posts/error-propagation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://joselopes.dev/posts/error-propagation/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="it-starts-with-why-not">It starts with: &lt;em>why not?&lt;/em>&lt;/h2>
