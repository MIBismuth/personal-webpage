<section class="level1"><h2 id="a-splitting-decision">A splitting decision</h2>
<p><a href="/posts/unconventional-typing-p1">Last post</a> I left of with a banger software based typing setup. I got my Colemak-dh, my homerow mods (which I extensively praised) and my layers all neatly integrated into my workflow, it was great! However, lingering around was still an unease, a general feeling of disquiet. And this feeling was one I could quite literally get my hands on. My issue wasn&rsquo;t with the way I typed, you see, it was but with the keyboard itself! It bothered me: there was still further optimization to be done.</p>
<p>Allow me explain. What if I told you&rsquo;ve been lied to? What if I told you the standard keyboard <strong>shape</strong>, i.e. the way the keys are positioned, is not really designed with ergonomics in mind? Ever wondered why the keys don&rsquo;t align with each other into a neat little grid? Ever considered the possibility that the strongest and most agile finger, the thumb, could be used to hit more that the space bar?</p>
<p>Peaked your interest? Let me introduce you to the world of split ergonomic keyboards. Yet again down another rabbit hole.</p>
</section>
<section class="level1"><h2 id="choosing-the-right-keyboard">Choosing the right keyboard</h2>
<p>With all that said, there are pretty valid concerns with the way standard keyboards are designed, how it affects your typing posture and how it can spiral into other health issues. I&rsquo;m not an expert, and as such I&rsquo;m not gonna delve too much into them. To be completely honest, I just wanted a chance to play around with electronics and build a really cool custom mechanical keyboard. In this post I hope to share some of what I learned building my own.</p>
<p>I like to think of keyboards as being categorized along 4 axis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split / Non Split</li>
<li>Row Staggered / Column Staggered / Ortholinear layout</li>
<li>Number of keys</li>
<li>Flat / Tenting / Weird Madness</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a collection of popular keyboards I looked into while doing my research, complete with their respective distribution among the categories.</p>
<p>HERE I HAVE TO FACT CHECK THESE NUMBERS, LIKE SOME ARE PER HAND, OTHERS PER WHOLE KEYBOARD!</p>

<p>In the end, I went with the <a href="https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58">Lily58</a>. I felt like it was a fairly conservative choice at the time and that proved to be right. It was split and column staggered, the main things I wanted to try, while maintaining a <em>sane</em> number of keys, which allowed me to keep the number row. Further, since the design was open hardware, that gave me the chance to source my own parts and assemble it all by myself, which would make it a significantly cheaper than the pre-built options (I was not about to drop 300‚Ç¨ on a keyboard I didn&rsquo;t even know I&rsquo;d like).</p>
</section>
<section class="level1"><h2 id="ordering-parts">Ordering parts</h2>
<p>When choosing the parts for your keyboard, the main components you need to worry about are:</p>
<h3 id="pcbs">PCB&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>This ultimately comes down to choosing (or designing) the keyboard, as discussed on the last section. Some things to look for are switch compatibility and hot-swap compatibility. Optionally, you might also want a board with support for LEDs, OLED display or encoders.</p>
<h3 id="microcontrollers">Microcontrollers</h3>
<p>The microcontroller is what, well, controls the whole keyboard. It detects the keypresses and sends the information to the computer via USB. The most common form factor for these is the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/pro-micro-5v-16mhz.html">pro-micro</a> and there are a ton of compatible clones out there! Some come with more p swerful chips, like the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/rp2040/">rp2040</a> instead of the classic <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/ATmega32U4">ATmega32U4</a>, so thats something to look out for if you want a fancy animated display. If you want Bluetooth keyboard, you&rsquo;ll want something like a <a href="https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/">nice!nano</a>.</p>
<p>As for firmware, you got <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a> for wired and <a href="https://zmk.dev/">ZMK</a> for wireless setups. They are extensively customizable, with all the cool features like layers, tap-mod keys, key-combos, etc. And if that&rsquo;s not enough you could always rock your own firmware!</p>
<h3 id="swithes-and-keycaps">Swithes and keycaps</h3>
<p>Alright, keyboard switches really are an entire world. They really come down to personal preference. I&rsquo;d just double check that the switch type you choose is supported by the PCB. There are two main designs that came up during my research: MX style and Choc style. I ended up with Kailh Choc Pro-Reds and really like them.</p>
<h3 id="other-optional-components">Other optional components</h3>
<ol>
<li>Diodes</li>
<li>Hot-swap sockets</li>
<li>TRS cable and sockets</li>
<li>Batterys (if wireless)</li>
<li>LED&rsquo;s (if RGB)</li>
<li>OLED displays</li>
<li>Reset buttons</li>
<li>Encoders</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="breaking-down-costs">Breaking down costs</h3>
<p>Ok, now for the most important part, how much did this all cost? Let me break it down for you:</p>

<p>Ok, so as you can see it was not cheap, unfortunately :(</p>
<p>I really played it safe by ordering the kit from SplitKB. Since it was my first build I really just wanted it to work, so paid a little more for the convenience of having the PCB&rsquo;s and all the other small components (diodes, hot-swap sockets, resistors, jacks) in a nice package from a reputable source that I had guarantee would work.</p>
<p>Also, holy shit are switches and keycaps ever expensive! Especially for the Choc style switches, the pricing really caught me off guard, even buying from AliExpress. The good thing is that I was smart enough to get hot-swaps instead of soldering the switches to the board, that way if I want to do another build in the future I can just use these existing switches and keycaps.</p>
<p>If I were to do it again, I&rsquo;d definitely be a little less scared of sourcing all of the components individually. Perhaps even looking into getting the PCB&rsquo;s from a PCB manufacturing service, since its an open design. Further, if budget was my key concern, I&rsquo;d 3d print the keycaps.</p>
<p>All in all, I&rsquo;d say I didn&rsquo;t do that bad. I was conservative, yes, but also got a working keyboard with really solid parts (the PBT keycaps are really nice) and still beat the price of a pre-assembled keyboard by some margin. When it comes down to it, I guess these things are just niche and expensive.</p>
