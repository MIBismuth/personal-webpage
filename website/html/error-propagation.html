            class="header-section-number">1</span> It starts with:
            <em>why not?</em></h1>
            <p>This whole project came about during one of the many
            ‚Äúdude, we need to get rich‚Äù conversations between me and my
            good friend Jo√£o Rei.</p>
            <p>We knew we had to solve a <em>real world</em> problem.
            Here‚Äôs why <strong>calculating error propagations</strong>
            was one of the first things that popped up.</p>
            <section id="understanding-the-problem-why-it-sucks"
            class="level2" data-number="1.1">
            <h2 data-number="1.1"><span
            class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Understanding the
            problem: why it sucks</h2>
            <p>For context, calculating error propagations was a very
            common task on our bachelor‚Äôs physics laboratories.</p>
            <section id="the-theory" class="level3" data-number="1.1.1">
            <h3 data-number="1.1.1"><span
            class="header-section-number">1.1.1</span> The theory</h3>
            <p>Imagine you are trying to experimentally estimate some
            value <span class="math inline">F</span> from measurements
            <span class="math inline">x</span>, <span
            class="math inline">y</span>, <span
            class="math inline">z</span>. You could write it as:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">
            F = F(x,y,z)
            </span></p>
            <p>Now, each of those measurements has an associated
            experimental error (or uncertainty, whatever, I‚Äôll leave the
            correct terms for the physicists): <span
            class="math inline">\delta x</span>, <span
            class="math inline">\delta y</span>, <span
            class="math inline">\delta z</span>. These will have an
            impact on the error of <span
            class="math inline">F</span>.</p>
            <p>One way to quantify this impact is to take a first order
            approach and sum the max error across all variables.
            Basically saying ‚Äúyeah, <span class="math inline">F</span>
            is linear around <span class="math inline">x</span>, so if
            we move <span class="math inline">F</span> by <span
            class="math inline">\delta x</span> we should get a good
            estimate of <span class="math inline">\delta F</span>‚Äù.</p>
            <p>Mathematically:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">
            \delta F = \sum_{x_i} |\frac{d F}{d x_i}|\delta x_i
            </span></p>
            <p>In the example above:</p>
            <p><span class="math display">
            \delta F(x,y,z) = |\frac{d F}{d x}|\delta x + |\frac{d F}{d
            y}|\delta y + |\frac{d F}{d z}|\delta z
            </span></p>
            </section>
            <section id="reality" class="level3" data-number="1.1.2">
            <h3 data-number="1.1.2"><span
            class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Reality</h3>
            <p>On the real world these error expressions can be huge and
            messy.</p>
            <p>To make matters worse, you‚Äôd often have your measurements
            on an Excel spreadsheet, meaning you‚Äôd have to translate
            this whole mess onto an Excel formula and replace all the
            variables with their appropriate cells.</p>
            <figure>
            <img src="../images/excel-pain-cropped.gif"
            alt="Excel Pain" />
            <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Excel Pain</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Plus, you had to repeat this process multiple times per
            lab for different values, all with different expressions and
            corresponding cells!</p>
            <p>All of these factors combined made for a really
            unpleasant experience, and being the one designated to do
            this task was akin to drawing the shortest straw on doomed
            mission.</p>

            <h2 data-number="1.2"><span
            class="header-section-number">1.2</span> The solution</h2>
            <p>To solve this problem efficiently, we needed a program to
            do the following:</p>
            <ol type="1">
            <li>take in any math expression with common operators</li>
            <li>automatically detect all the variables present</li>
            <li>give the user a chance to mark differentiation variables
            or constants</li>
            <li>give the user the chance to change the name of a
            variable and it‚Äôs error (for example, to excel cells)</li>
            <li>return the error propagation expression, which could be
            copy pasted into Python, Excel or Latex</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We also wanted to make it as accessible and portable as
            possible, so a Web application was the perfect target!</p>
            <p>Why not just do it?</p>
            </section>

            <section id="theres-a-how-and-a-why-not" class="level1"

            class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Simple Python
            implementation</h2>
            <p>We quickly cooked together an implementation using <a
            href="https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html">Python‚Äôs
            SymPy</a> library.</p>
            <p>First, we use SymPy‚Äôs <a
            href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/parsing.html"><code>parse_expr</code></a>
            to get the expression object.</p>
            <div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
            class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> sympy <span class="im">as</span> sp</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>expr <span class="op">=</span> sp.parsing.sympy_parser.parse_expr(expr_string)</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>Next, we can get all the variables in the expression
            with:</p>
            <div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
            class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>variable_set <span class="op">=</span> expr.free_symbols</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>Finally, we can loop through all the (usable) variables
            in the expression and construct the error propagation
            string. The partial derivative can be calculated using <a
            href="https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorials/intro-tutorial/calculus.html#derivatives"><code>diff()</code></a>
            method.</p>
            <div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
            class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="cf">for</span> index, var <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">enumerate</span>(variable_set):</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>        <span class="cf">if</span> (usable_list[index]):</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>            final <span class="op">=</span> final <span class="op">+</span> <span class="ss">f&quot; + abs(</span><span class="sc">{</span><span class="bu">str</span>(expr.diff(var))<span class="sc">}</span><span class="ss">)*Œ¥</span><span class="sc">{</span>var<span class="sc">}</span><span class="ss">&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
            <p>Great! Now we can just hook it up to a <a
            href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> backend and
            be done with it. It‚Äôs just that simple!</p>

            <p>The first issue that caught our attention was the
            (possibility of) high processing times.</p>
            <p>For <em>regular expected use‚Ñ¢</em> this wasn‚Äôt a problem,
            in only took a couple of seconds maximum. However, the user
            is evil and could just input the most diabolical of
            expressions and take the whole server hostage for minutes.

            of characters</h4>
            <p>We thought about limiting the number of characters the
            user could input.</p>
            <p>However, this was not suitable and would end up
            sacrificing the quality of our service too much, since
            mundane expressions could be long due to long variable
            names. Personally, I also hate this type of hard-coded
            solutions.</p>
            <p>Most importantly, as we would soon find out, it didn‚Äôt
            take a lot of characters to stall (or kill for that matter)
            our server.</p>

            Multi-threading</h4>
            <p>To mitigate the possible long processing times, we tried
            implementing a multi-threaded approach, where each error
            propagation request was computed on a different Python
            Thread with a maximum processing time, after which the
            Thread was killed.</p>
            <p>This seemed like a nice solution, however we had neither
            the time nor experience to make it work.</p>
            <p>Said implementation ended up being extremely janky.
            Particularly, if the input expression was something like
            <code>1000^1000000000^1000000</code>, it would stall trying
            to evaluate that expression and for <strong>some
            reason</strong> the worker thread refused to die no matter
            what.</p>
            <p>Wait, it would <strong>evaluate</strong> the expression?
            Oh no‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>If high processing time was potentially service breaking,

            is a very powerful tool that allows for the execution of
            arbitrary code as a Python expression. I‚Äôm not gonna pretend
            to be cybersecurity expert, but I had participated in a few
            CTF events with Python Jailbreaks and knew better than to
            try to fight against this security vulnerability.</p>
            <p>Once I tried calculating the error propagation of
            <code>__import__('os').system('reboot')</code> and the my
            computer just, well, rebooted, I knew this was not gonna
            work.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, we just didn‚Äôt have the necessary
            skill or resources to implement a usable backend. The
            potential processing complexity and security risks involved
            made it just not worth it. If only there was a way to pass
            this computational burden onto the users themselves.</p>

            <p>We gave up speed (the js implementation was anywhere from
            2 to 5x slower) and better expression simplifications for a
            simpler and a lot more robust alternative, with near
            infinite scaling. As an added bonus, the fact that it did
            not require a backend made it perfect to host on one of the

            <p>So far, this post has been mostly dedicated to the inner
            workings of the error propagation algorithm itself. However,
            I‚Äôd like to also briefly highlight one of the main issues I
            faced as a first time web developer: there are (seemingly)
            way too many options!</p>

            <h2 data-number="4.1"><span
            class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Decisions</h2>
            <p>When starting out this project, the first thing I did was
            look up what tools I should use on YouTube. I probably
            clicked on one of the many ‚Äútop 10 web/tech stacks of 202*‚Äù
            and, just like that, I was hooked. I must have spent days
            watching every single tier list, every review, every
            <em>pros and cons</em> and reading every single comment on
            all the YouTube, Reddit and Blog posts, agonizing over the
            apparently <strong>life changing</strong> decision that was
            choosing a front-end framework.</p>
            <p>In the process, I ended up adding a lot of technologies
            that were frankly useless for my use case, like TypeScript.
            A confession, fellow readers: even today I don‚Äôt really know
            the difference between it and JavaScript! But I absolutely
            ‚Äúhad to have it‚Äù according to all the experts.</p>
            <p>It really isn‚Äôt all that.</p>
            <p>I still think doing research is important, and don‚Äôt
            regret (finally) choosing <a
            href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> (quite like the
            thing), but as a beginner that time was probably better
            spent learning the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and maybe
            JavaScript. After all, how can one really comprehend what a
            modern framework brings to the table if they never really
            <em>played with default settings</em>?</p>

            class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Indecisions</h2>
            <p>This second problem came as a direct consequence of the
            first: I started second guessing the tools I chose.</p>
            <p>After investing so much time analysing all the possible
            options, everything had to be perfect. Every time I hit a
            small road block the immediate reaction was to blame the
            software and myself for choosing it, when in reality I
            should have just been blaming myself for being bad at
            programming.</p>
            <p>For example, when the CSS style sheets got ‚Äúmessy‚Äù (it
            wasn‚Äôt even that bad), I introduced <a
            href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a>, which is
            great, I like it, but now it‚Äôs the middle of development and
            I‚Äôm in a call with my partner being like ‚Äúno, no, you don‚Äôt
            understand this is so much better, this is the future,
            totally worth learning trust me bro‚Ñ¢‚Äù</p>

            <p>It can be quite easy to find yourself obsessing over
            everything that is new.</p>
            <p>When starting, it might be a good idea to focus on the
            basics first. Only by using something is it possible to
            understand it‚Äôs strengths and pitfalls.</p>
            <p>Further, it is important to understand when to try a
            different approach, like when we had to rewrite the Python
            backend and move it to the frontend. But perhaps equally as
            important is to realize when it is not worth the time to do
            it.</p>
            <p>In the end, you might end up finding that the defaults
            are all you need.</p>
