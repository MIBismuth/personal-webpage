## A splitting decision

[Last post](/posts/unconventional-typing-p1) I left of with a banger software based typing setup. I got my Colemak-dh, my homerow mods (which I extensively praised) and my layers all neatly integrated into my workflow, it was great! However, lingering around was still an unease, a general feeling of disquiet. And this feeling was one I could quite literally get my hands on. My issue wasn't with the way I typed, you see, it was but with the keyboard itself! It bothered me: there was still further optimization to be done.

Allow me explain. What if I told you've been lied to? What if I told you the standard keyboard **shape**, i.e. the way the keys are positioned, is not really designed with ergonomics in mind? Ever wondered why the keys don't align with each other into a neat little grid? Ever considered the possibility that the strongest and most agile finger, the thumb, could be used to hit more that the space bar? 

Peaked your interest? Let me introduce you to the world of split-ergonomic keyboards. Yet again down another rabbit hole.


## Choosing the right keyboard

To be completely honest, I just wanted a chance to play around with electronics and build a custom mechanical keyboard.
